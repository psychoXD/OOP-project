These are the classes and forms I made for the student view. They should work if you drop them into the src directory of the project folder. 
I added a few methods to the database class, so remember to change the password back for the sql connection.
To integrate these with the project, just call the constructor for the studentgui in the if statement where the staffgui is also called.
